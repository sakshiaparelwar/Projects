      Lata Mangeshkar, also known as the 'Nightingale of India', was one of the
      most versatile singers in the Indian film industry. Lata was born on
      September 28, 1929, to classical singer and theatre artist Pandit
      Deenanath Mangeshkar and Shevanti in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Her father
      started teaching her music at an early age. By the time she was five, Lata
      was seen participating as an actress in plays written by her father. Her
      siblings - Meena, Asha, Usha, and Hridaynath - are all accomplished
      singers and musicians.

      In a career spanning nearly eight decades, Lata Mangeshkar was the singing
      voice for a bevy of Bollywood leading ladies. She lent her voice to over
      5,000 songs in over a thousand Hindi and 36 regional films. She had an
      unprecedented impact on Indian film music. Since 1942, Lata pushed back
      the boundaries of music with her mind-boggling skills. Over the years,
      Lata had sung for actresses from Madhubala to Priyanka Chopra. Best known
      for her versatile voice quality, she recorded albums of all kinds
      (ghazals, pop, etc).
